(1) “Graphics-diagnostics.R”: This file is mainly used to generate scatter plots, funnel plots, forest plots and leave-one-out plots in MR analysis. The generated graphic samples are shown below
(2) “MR-CAUSE.R”: This file is mainly used to generate the results of the MR-CAUSE method
(3) “Multi-Mendelian-Randomization.R”: This file is mainly used to generate the results of multivariate MR
(4) “Power-calculation.R”: This file is mainly used to calculate the power for each univariate MR analysis
(5) “R2-calculation.R”: This file is mainly used to calculate the F-statistic and explained variance of each IV
(6) “Uni-Mendelian-Randomization.R”: This file is mainly used to generate the results of univariate MR. Seven methods are included: IVW, Simple median, Weighted median, Weighted mode, DIVW, MR-RAPS, MR-PRESSO. It is also used to calculate Cochran's Q P value, Egger Intercept and other sensitivity analyses.
(7) “Veen.R”: This file is mainly used to generate Venn and Upset plots of sample overlap between different traits.
